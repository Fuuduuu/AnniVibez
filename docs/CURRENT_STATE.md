# CURRENT_STATE

Status: compact operational snapshot for future Majandus passes.

## Product and production

- visible product: `Majandus`
- current accepted runtime: `062cdcbe6488282854cbb7d8fcf2309c50360dec` (`feat: improve calendar usability`)
- canonical production: `https://annivibe.pages.dev`
- production and human phone validation: PASS

## Accepted product state

- Majandus application shell: Kodu, Kalender, Buss, Veel and Seaded.
- Household calendar, waste/household functionality and reminders are accepted.
- Existing Buss functionality is preserved, including concrete stop_id routing, nearby departures and map destination selection.
- Motion polish is accepted at `20ac51b481c1b2a7ea58ce2251f28ceb96f31046` (`style: add subtle native motion`): subtle page entrance, tactile navigation and press feedback, calendar state motion, event-dialog entrance and reduced-motion support.
- Calendar UX v2 is accepted at `062cdcbe6488282854cbb7d8fcf2309c50360dec`: visible `+ Lisa`, integrated `Täna`, month-aligned selected-day content, the legend after selected-day content, essential-first event creation and truthful advanced options.

## Protected boundaries

- Preserve current bus routing behavior and concrete stop_id identity; `depsWithMeta(...)` and `displayCodes` remain transitional where present.
- Preserve calendar recurrence and imported-event protections.
- Preserve local-only data until an accepted migration plan exists.
- Do not reopen Trends in v1 or combine unrelated feature work.

## Evidence

- Motion polish validation: `211 PASS`, `0 FAIL`; human phone review: PASS.
- Calendar UX v2 validation: `206 PASS`, `0 FAIL`; production smoke and human phone review: PASS.
- These are pass-specific validation results, not the repository-wide test total.

## Next action

- **COMMON_BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE** (`architecture / planning`).
- Planning only: no backend implementation, persistence replacement, authentication integration, database creation, migration, secrets or deploy configuration changes.
